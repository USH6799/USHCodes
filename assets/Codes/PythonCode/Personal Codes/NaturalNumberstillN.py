n = int(input("Enter the value of n : "))
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Using For Loop:

for i in range(1, n + 1 , 1): # Here, the value of var 'i' is less than n+1 and it gives the output as True and the for loop is executed.
    
    print(i) # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    
# ----------------------------------------------------------    
# Using While Loop:

i = 1 # Here, the value of var 'i' is 1 and it gives the output as True and the while loop is executed.

while i < n + 1: # Here, the value of var 'i' is less than n+1 and it gives the output as True and the while loop is executed.
    
    print(i) # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    
    i = i + 1 # Here, the value of var 'i' is increased by 1 and it gives the output as True and the while loop is executed.
