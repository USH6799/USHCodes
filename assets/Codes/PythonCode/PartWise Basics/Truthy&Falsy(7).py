# TRUTHY & FALSY
# ----------------------------------------------------------

# If you convert any value into boolean datatype, then it can be converted into two values either True or False.

# Like, 

a = 25 # An integer variable 'a' storing 25. 
print(bool(a)) # You know the output will be True but the question arises, how? How does 25 become true?

b = 0 # An integer variable 'b' storing 0. 
print(bool(b)) # You know the output will be False but the question arises, how? How does 0 become false?

# More examples:

str1 = "What will be the value?" # A string variable 'str1' storing a string value inside the double quotes.
print(bool(str1)) # You know the output will be True but the question arises, how? How does the string value become true?

str2 = "" # A string variable 'str2' storing nothing inside the double quotes.
print(bool(str2)) # You know the output will be False but the question arises, how? How does an empty string value become false?
