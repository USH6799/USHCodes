# LOGICAL OPERATORS,
# ----------------------------------------------------------


# Means, it returns True or False based on the conditions.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# AND OPERATOR

a = 10 # Here the value of var 'a' is 10 of integer datatype.

b = 20 # Here the value of var 'b' is 20 of integer datatype.

print(a > b and a < b) # Here, the value of var 'a' is greater than 'b' and 'a' is less than 'b' and it gives the output as False.

# In and operator, if both the conditions are true then it returns true otherwise it returns false.
# if the first condition is true and the second condition is false then it returns false.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# OR OPERATOR

a = 10 # Here the value of var 'a' is 10 of integer datatype.

b = 20 # Here the value of var 'b' is 20 of integer datatype.

print(a > b or a < b) # Here, the value of var 'a' is greater than 'b' and 'a' is less than 'b' and it gives the output as True.

# In or operator, if any one of the conditions is true then it returns true otherwise it returns false.

# if the first condition is false and the second condition is true then it returns true.

# if both the conditions are false then it returns false.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# NOT OPERATOR

# Means, it returns True if the condition is false and returns False if the condition is true.

a = 10 # Here the value of var 'a' is 10 of integer datatype.

b = 20 # Here the value of var 'b' is 20 of integer datatype.

print(not a > b) # Here, the value of var 'a' is greater than 'b' which is true and 'not' operator inverts it and gives the output as False.

# the comparison operators Always returns boolean values either True or False.
