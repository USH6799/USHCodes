 # What is the use of OOPs
 
    # 1. Make your code more reusable.
    # 2. Easier to work with large Programs.
    # 3. OOPs program prevents us from repeating codes.
    # 4. OOPs Provide Security to our program.

 # What We need?
 
    # What is Encapsulation?
    # What is Class and Object?
    # Creating class Attributes and class methods.
    # Diffrence btw public and private class Attributes and Methods.
    # Making Classe's object.
    # What is Constructor fnc?
    # Object Attributes and Methods.
    # What is Polymorphism?
    # What is inheritance?
    # What is Abstraction?
    
# ----------------------------------------------------------   
 # there Are mainly 4 Pillars in OOPs Programming
    # 1. Encapsulation
    # 2. Inheritance
    # 3. Polymorphism
    # 4. Abstraction
    
# ----------------------------------------------------------
 # What are classes and Objects.
 
 # Classes are the blueprints for creating diffrent objects, they also know as object factory.
 
 # Like, A car factory , imagine it is a class
 
 # Now it needs three requirements like body type , tyres , and engine type to create a car.
 
 # Object are the instances of class, they have their own behaviour , attributes and methods or functions.
 
 # Like A Car factory (class),
 
 # Ferrari(object) : Covered(body) , 2 layers(tyres) and 8 cycle(Engine).
 
 # Lord Alto(object) : Covered(body) , 1 layer(tyres) and 4 cycle(Engine).

 # Splendor(object) : open(body) , 3 layers(tyres) and 8 cycle(Engine).

 # Above all vechiles are the object of Car factory, means car factory is the class which is a blueprint of vechiles(requirements) and creates the object.
 
 # all vechiles are the instance of the class.
 
 
# ----------------------------------------------------------
 # What is Abstraction?
 
    # Abstraction is the process of showing essential data to the user and hiding the unnecessary data from the user.
    
    # It means showing essential data to the user and hiding the unnecessary data from the user.
    
    # It is done by using private and public methods.
    
    # Real life example of Abstraction is:
    
        # A Brake of a car, As a driver we know that how to use brake and when to use brake, we know what to press to apply brake and slowdown or stop our car.
        
        # But, we Don't know the inside process after pressing brakes, like what happens that makes moving tyres slow or stop.
        
        # As a Car maker, they also show only the Essential information to the user or driver like where is brake and what to press, but they hide the backend or unnecessary information from the user or driver like functionality of brake in stopping the moving tyres and the engine.
        
        # This makes the code secure and not accessible to diffrent classes.
        

# ----------------------------------------------------------
 # What is Encapsulation?
 
    # Encapsulation is the process of hiding the data of the class from the outside world.
    
    # It makes the code secure and unaccessible to diffrent classes.
    
    # it can only be accessed through the class at specific methods or ways.
    
    # Real life example of Encapsulation is:
    
    # like a Lecture class , and a condition there is only the fees paid specific students can access it or attend it and the other students can't. This means that class is encapsulated.
    
    # In a open lecture class , anyone can attend the lecture, listen and watch which means no restriction and no security. This means this class is not encapsulated.
    
    
# ----------------------------------------------------------
 # What is Polymorphism?
 
    # Polymorphism means many forms, it is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
    
    # Real life example of Polymorphism is:
    
        # Like a Smart Phone , it can be used to make calls, send messages, play games, browse the internet, etc.
        
        # A Phone has the property of calculator and the property of camera, property of radio etc.
        
        # this means one phone has many features.
        

        # Another real life example is a person.
        
        # On earth , he is a Human.
        
        # In Office , He is the boss.
        
        # For his parents, he is their son.
        
        # For His Kids, he is their father.
        
        # So One person, has many diffrent forms in respect of the time , place and the person whom he met or belong.
        

# ----------------------------------------------------------
 # What is inheritance?
 
 # Inheritance means taking the features of another class to its own, means inheriting their features and using them.
 
 # The Most Simplest and Best Example Of inheritance in real life is:
 
 # GENETICS IN BIOLOGY
 
 # Like my father has a brown colored eye but my mother has a black colored eye.

 # We are 2 kids of my parents: Me and my brother.
 
 # So, i am having brown colored eyes , so i can say that i inherited this feature from my father. 
 
 # But my brother has black colored eyes, so i can say that i inherited this feature from my mother.
