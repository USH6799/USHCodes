# ----------------------------------------------------------


# COMPARISON OPERATORS: Means, it compares the values of two variables and returns either True or False.

# like,

a = 10 # Here the value of var 'a' is 10 of integer datatype.

b = 20 # Here the value of var 'b' is 20 of integer datatype.

print(a < b) # Here, the value of var 'a' is less than 'b' and it gives the output as True.

a = 10 # Here the value of var 'a' is 10 of integer datatype.

b = 20 # Here the value of var 'b' is 20 of integer datatype.

print(a > b) # Here, the value of var 'a' is greater than 'b' and it gives the output as False.
