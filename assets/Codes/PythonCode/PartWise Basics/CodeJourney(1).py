# 1. Difference between Compiler and Interpreter
# ----------------------------------------------------------

# Compiler -> Takes a set of code at once, converts it into different forms of code, and gives the final code as binary code which is later executed by the computer. Example - Java.

# Interpreter -> Takes a line of code, converts it into binary code, runs it, then moves to the next line of code, and repeats the same process for each line of code. Example - JavaScript.

# Python is an interpreted language. It means it uses an interpreter to execute its code.
