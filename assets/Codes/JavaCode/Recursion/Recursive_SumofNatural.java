/*
DRY RUN:
---------
Example: If user enters 4

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. The user enters 4.
3. The main function reads the entered number (4).
4. The main function calls the sum_of_n function with the value of 'n' as 4.
5. Inside the sum_of_n function:
    - It checks if 'n' is equal to 0. Since it's not, it proceeds to the next step.
6. It makes a recursive call to the sum_of_n function with 'n - 1', i.e., 3.
7. Inside the recursive call (n = 3):
    - It checks if 'n' is equal to 0. Since it's not, it proceeds to the next step.
8. It makes another recursive call to the sum_of_n function with 'n - 1', i.e., 2.
9. Inside the recursive call (n = 2):
    - It checks if 'n' is equal to 0. Since it's not, it proceeds to the next step.
10. It makes another recursive call to the sum_of_n function with 'n - 1', i.e., 1.
11. Inside the recursive call (n = 1):
    - It checks if 'n' is equal to 0. Since it's not, it proceeds to the next step.
12. It makes another recursive call to the sum_of_n function with 'n - 1', i.e., 0.
13. Inside the recursive call (n = 0):
    - It checks if 'n' is equal to 0. Since it is, the base case is satisfied, and it returns 0.
    - The sum of 1 and 0 is calculated and returned.
    - The sum of 2 and 1 is calculated and returned.
    - The sum of 3 and 3 is calculated and returned.
    - The sum of 4 and 6 is calculated and returned.
14. The total sum (10) is returned to the main function.
15. Finally, the total sum (10) is displayed.
