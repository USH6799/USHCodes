Dry Run:
Input: Range from 1 to 100

Step 1: Initialize Variables
start = 1
end = 100
numbers = [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]
luckyNumbers = []
index = 1
size = 100

Step 2: Loop to find and remove lucky numbers
Iteration 1:
    Removing every 1st number from the list
    numbers = [2, 4, 6, ..., 100]
    size = 50
Iteration 2:
    Removing every 2nd number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 10, ..., 98]
    size = 33
Iteration 3:
    Removing every 3rd number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, ..., 96]
    size = 25
Iteration 4:
    Removing every 4th number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ..., 92]
    size = 20
Iteration 5:
    Removing every 5th number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, ..., 90]
    size = 16
Iteration 6:
    Removing every 6th number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90]
    size = 14
Iteration 7:
    Removing every 7th number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90]
    size = 13
Iteration 8:
    Removing every 8th number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90]
    size = 12
Iteration 9:
    Removing every 9th number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90]
    size = 11
Iteration 10:
    Removing every 10th number from the list
    numbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90]
    size = 10

Step 3: Copy the remaining numbers to the lucky numbers list
luckyNumbers = [2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90]

Step 4: Printing the lucky numbers
"Lucky numbers in the range 1 to 100 are: 2 6 12 20 30 42 56 72 90"
