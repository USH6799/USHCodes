/*
Dry Run:

1. Program execution starts from the main method.
2. Scanner object 'scanner' is created to take user input.
3. Prompt message "Enter a number: " is displayed.
4. User enters a number, e.g., 5.
5. The input number 5 is read and stored in the variable 'number'.
6. The square of 5 is calculated: 5 * 5 = 25, and stored in the variable 'square'.
7. The number 5 is converted to a string "5" and stored in 'numStr'.
8. The square 25 is converted to a string "25" and stored in 'squareStr'.
9. The program checks if "25" ends with "5":
   - Since "25" does end with "5", the condition is true.
10. The message "5 is an automorphic number." is printed.

Example 2:
1. User enters a number, e.g., 6.
2. The input number 6 is read and stored in the variable 'number'.
3. The square of 6 is calculated: 6 * 6 = 36, and stored in the variable 'square'.
4. The number 6 is converted to a string "6" and stored in 'numStr'.
5. The square 36 is converted to a string "36" and stored in 'squareStr'.
6. The program checks if "36" ends with "6":
   - Since "36" does end with "6", the condition is true.
7. The message "6 is an automorphic number." is printed.

Example 3:
1. User enters a number, e.g., 7.
2. The input number 7 is read and stored in the variable 'number'.
3. The square of 7 is calculated: 7 * 7 = 49, and stored in the variable 'square'.
4. The number 7 is converted to a string "7" and stored in 'numStr'.
5. The square 49 is converted to a string "49" and stored in 'squareStr'.
6. The program checks if "49" ends with "7":
   - Since "49" does not end with "7", the condition is false.
7. The message "7 is not an automorphic number." is printed.
