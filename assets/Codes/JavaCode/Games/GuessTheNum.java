/*
 * Dry Run:
 * 
 * Welcome message for the game is displayed.
 * 
 * Infinite loop starts to keep the game running until the user decides to exit.
 * 
 * Prompted to choose the difficulty level.
 * 
 * User enters the difficulty level choice.
 * 
 * If the chosen level is "easy":
 *     - Random number between 1 and 5 is generated for the user to guess.
 *     - User is allowed 5 guesses.
 *     - For each guess:
 *         - User is prompted to enter their guess.
 *         - User's guess is compared with the generated number.
 *         - Feedback is provided based on the guess (smaller, bigger, or correct).
 *         - If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the loop is exited.
 *     - If the user doesn't guess the number within 5 attempts, the loop exits automatically.
 * 
 * If the chosen level is "normal":
 *     - Random number between 1 and 10 is generated for the user to guess.
 *     - Similar steps are followed as in the "easy" level.
 * 
 * If the chosen level is "hard":
 *     - Random number between 1 and 15 is generated for the user to guess.
 *     - Similar steps are followed as in the "easy" level.
 * 
 * If the chosen level is none of the above:
 *     - User is informed that they chose the wrong mode.
 * 
 * The loop continues until the user decides to exit the game.
 * 
 * Scanner object is closed to prevent resource leak.
