/*
 * Dry Run:
 * 
 * User is prompted to enter a number.
 * 
 * User enters the number.
 * 
 * The entered number is stored in the variable 'n'.
 * 
 * Variable 'i' is initialized to 1.
 * 
 * Do-while loop begins:
 *     - 'i' is printed.
 *     - 'i' is incremented.
 *     - Loop continues until 'i' is less than or equal to 'n'.
 * 
 * Loop ends after printing numbers from 1 to 'n'.
 * 
 * Scanner object is closed to prevent resource leak.
