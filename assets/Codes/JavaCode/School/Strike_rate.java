/*
Dry Run Example:
1. Initialize variables:
   - run = 113
   - ball = 144

2. Calculate the Strike Rate:
   - Formula: (100 * run) / ball
   - Substitute values: (100 * 113) / 144
   - Calculation: 11300 / 144 â‰ˆ 78.47

3. Output:
   - The program prints: "The Cricketer Makes 113 Runs in 144 balls"
   - The program prints: "Strike Rate Of the Cricketer Is: 78.47222222222223"
   
Explanation:
- Strike rate is a measure of a cricketer's scoring efficiency, representing the number of runs scored per 100 balls faced.
- In this example, the cricketer scores 113 runs in 144 balls, resulting in a strike rate of approximately 78.47.
